See if you use this calculator without looking at the screen!
This was an exercise in creating accessible content.

You can use these Windows Narrator controls.

Windows + Ctrl + Enter
Turns Narrator on/off

Caps Lock
Stops Narrator from talking at any time (very helpful)

CapsLock + PageUp/PageDown
Changes what type of page item to navigate through.
For this app, you should need, "landmarks", "paragraphs", "items".

CapsLock + Left/Right
Moves forwards/backwards through the type of page item, e.g. next or previous landmark

Good luck!
